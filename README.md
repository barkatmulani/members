# Members Application

The front-end project in the client was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

There are two project directories available:

### `server` directory
Contains the back-end project based in Node & Typescript.

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `client` directory
Contains the front-end project based in React & Typescript.

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
